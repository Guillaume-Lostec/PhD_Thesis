## Abstract

In this dissertation, I first propose a continuum theory of fatigue fracture in viscoelastic solids. I predict the crack extension per loading cycle for various loading amplitudes, loading frequencies and viscoelastic properties. This is achieved by examining the energy dissipated through viscous effects and the energy available for driving crack growth. In particular, energy dissipation is controlled by an interplay of three time scales: the material relaxation time, the timescale associated with crack propagation (i.e., crack speed) and the loading frequency. By tracking the stress history of material points around the crack tip under concurrent crack propagation and cyclic loading, I derive an integral equation governing crack speed within a loading cycle. Comparisons between numerical solutions of the theory and finite element simulations demonstrate that it predicts the influence of material parameters and loading conditions on fatigue fracture at a much lower computational cost. The second part of this work focuses on the interpretation of toughness measurements in neo-Hookean solids with Mullins effect. Specifically, I present a series of finite element simulations of pure shear fracture tests, where I varied the sample geometry and the material properties to study their influence on toughness measurements. Based on my results, I provide guidelines to meaningfully compare different materials through simple mechanical tests. Finally, in the last part of this dissertation I propose a multi-scale modeling approach to understand damage in carbon fiber reinforced polymers.
